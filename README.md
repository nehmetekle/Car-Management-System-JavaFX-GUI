# Car-Management-System-JavaFX-GUI
The main idea of this project is to design a Car Dealer Management System using JavaFX for GUI, and DBMS.
The system enables the admin several actions such as adding/removing employees, setting employees basic informations such as firstname\lastname\...\monthly salary, adding/removing cars, checking the statistics of sold and which car brands we have the most.
All details will be saved in a database.

for each new employee, the system generates a unique IDENTIFER which will be used for him to log into the system(and he wont be able to log into admin section "Restricted").
The employee has few options such as Add car, sell car, show list of available/sold cars.

The admin has also a unique ID which will be used only by him to log into the system.
The admin has several options such as viewing the Company Informations, listing all available/sold cars, adding/removing employees, 
editing informations about an employee, and showing the statistics of the company based on our database.

I also want to mention, I and my partner we developed this program as our final project at our University - Programming III(JavaFX).
